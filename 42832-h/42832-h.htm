<p class="caption2"><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</p>


<p>I have been induced to present this Volume to the Public
by two considerations. The figures and descriptions contained
in the works entitled &ldquo;The Birds of America,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Ornithological Biography, or an Account of the Habits of
the Birds of the United States,&rdquo; having been issued in the
miscellaneous manner which was thought best adapted to the
occasion, or which was rendered necessary by circumstances,
seemed to require a systematic index, in which the nomenclature
should be corrected, and the species arranged agreeably
to my present views. This Synopsis, then, will afford
a methodical catalogue of all the species hitherto discovered
in the vast regions, extending from the northern confines
of Mexico to the Polar Seas, and which have been described,
and, with few exceptions, depicted in the works above
named. Another important object has been to present an
arrangement of these birds, so characterized, that a person
desirous of studying them, might, without much difficulty,
be enabled to discover their names, and trace some of the
most important features in their organization.</p>

<p>The species are disposed into genera and families; and,
although the location of the groups is not such as, in all respects,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
to satisfy me, the arrangement will, I trust, be found
in some degree useful. It will be seen that, although I have
adopted many of the modern groups, I have not sectioned
our birds on so minutely divided a scale as that employed by
some recent writers. Besides the characters of the Families,
Genera, and Species, which are given with considerable detail,
I have presented a short account of the Geographical Distribution
of the species, and references to the principal authors
by whom they have been described. I am confident that
these notices will suffice to enable the student to determine
with certainty any species that may come under his consideration,
and that the information respecting its habits,
which he will find in the works referred to, will afford him
at least sufficient knowledge to form a basis for the more
extended observation which he may contemplate. To the
name of the genus I have appended that of the author by
whom it has been instituted; and with the specific names I
have dealt in the same manner, giving as authorities the
individuals who first employed them, although they may
have referred them to different genera. It is probable that
many errors have been made in this department; but I shall
be happy to see them corrected, as my wish is to do justice
to all.</p>

<p>On this occasion I have again to acknowledge the benefit
derived from the aid of my friend Mr <span class="smcap">Macgillivray</span>, whose
general knowledge of ornithology, and perfect candour, have
rendered his advice peculiarly valuable.</p>

<p>Male. Tarsus with a few scutella; toes terminally scutellate. Male
with the bill, cere, iris, and feet yellow; the head, the neck for half its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
length, the rump, upper and lower tail-coverts, and tail white; the
rest of the plumage chocolate-brown, the terminal margins of all the
feathers pale greyish-brown. Female similar. Young with the bill
brownish-black, iris dark brown, feet yellow; the general colour of
the plumage very dark chocolate, uniform, the feathers without edgings,
all white at the base, that colour appearing more or less on the
hind part, and more especially on the fore part and sides of the neck,
and on the sides of the body and lower wing-coverts; quills and tail-feathers
brownish-black, tinged with grey toward the base; the latter
with the greater part of the inner webs, and a portion of the outer
brownish-white, freckled with dusky. In more advanced stages the
colours of the plumage vary considerably in different individuals. The
general tint continues brown for several years, a variable and often a
large proportion of white, or brownish-white, appearing on the neck,
the lower part of the body, the sides, and under the wings, the tail
meanwhile gradually becoming white in freckled patches, some have
a large patch of brownish-white across the breast. When the feathers
are new, they are of a glossy deep brown, but when old and
worn they present a bleached appearance, and the upper parts are
often patched with pale brown or brownish-white. On account of
these circumstances, individuals of different ages, and shot at different
periods of the year, differ so much from each other in appearance, that
one might, without a very extended comparison, conceive that in a
collection of specimens, there might be several species. The bill remains
dark until the head and tail become white; the anterior tarsal
scutella differ from none to six, the posterior from nine to twelve; those
on the hind toe are four, on the middle toe from nine to thirteen.</p>

<p>This species forms a connecting link between <i>Sylvicola</i> and <i>Trichas</i>,
having the long pointed wings of the former, and the general appearance
of the latter, which it resembles, especially in its tail, which is
neither emarginate, nor marked with the white spots seen on that of
almost all the other Sylvicolæ, but which do not exist in the genus
Trichas. Some of the Sylvicolæ are, in like manner, assimilated to
Myiodoctes, and others to Vermivora. Of the former may be mentioned,
<i>Sylvicola Auduboni</i> and <i>S. coronata</i>; of the latter, <i>S. Blackburniæ</i>.</p>

<p>This species is nearly allied to <i>Anthus aquaticus</i> and <i>A. pratensis</i>,
more especially to the latter, from which it is distinguished by having
the bill much stouter, the tarsus longer, the hind claws stouter, more
curved, and much shorter, the colour of the feet much darker, in being
always much more rufous beneath, and in sometimes, when the summer
is advanced, being almost entirely unspotted there. From <i>A.
aquaticus</i> it is at once distinguished by the whitish band over the eye,
and the white on the outer tail-feathers. It indeed seems wonderful
that any ornithologist should have mistaken it for that species.</p>
